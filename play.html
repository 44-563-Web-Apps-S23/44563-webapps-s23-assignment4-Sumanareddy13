<h2>MODESTY BY PAUL HERVIEU</h2>
<p>
   <h6> JACQUES</h6> 
   <p class="speech"> You have always been the most charming of women, the most----</p>
<h6 class="HENRIETTE.">HENRIETTE.</h6>
<p class="speech">HENRIETTE Stop! It's exactly that sort of exaggeration that's begun to
    make me so unsure of myself. I want you to understand once for all,
    Jacques, I have a conscience, and, furthermore, it is beginning to
    develop. I have taken some important resolutions</p>.

<h6 class="JACQUES.">JACQUES.</h6>
<p class="speech">What _do_ you mean?</p> 

<h6 class="HENRIETTE.">HENRIETTE.</h6>
<p class="speech">I have resolved to better myself, to raise my moral and
    intellectual standards, and to do that I must be guided, criticised----</p> 
<h6 class="JACQUES.">JACQUES.</h6> 
<p class="speech">But you already possess every imaginable quality! You are
charitable, cultured, refined----</p>

<h6 class="HENRIETTE.">>HENRIETTE.</h6>
<p class="direction">[_Annoyed._] </p>
<p class="speech">Please!</p>

<p class="direction"> [_Turns away and sits on settee._ JACQUES _addresses her from
    behind chair_.]</p>

<h6 class="JACQUES.">JACQUES.</h6>
<p class="speech"> You are discreet, witty----</p>

<h6 class="HENRIETTE.">HENRIETTE.</h6> 
<p class="speech">The same old compliments! Everybody tells me that. I want to
    be preached to, contradicted, scolded----</p>
<h6 class="JACQUES.">JACQUES.</h6> 
<p class="speech">You could never stand _that_.</p>
<h6 class="HENRIETTE.">HENRIETTE.</h6>
<p class="speech">Yes, I could. I should be happy to profit by the criticism.
    It would inspire me.</p> 
<h6 class="JACQUES.">JACQUES</h6>
<p class="speech">I'd like to see the man who has the audacity to criticise you
    to your face----</p>
<h6 class="HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE</h6>
<p class="speech">That is enough! I trust you are aware that you are not the
    person fit to exercise this influence over me?</p>
<h6 class="JACQUES">JACQUES.</h6>
<p class="speech"> How could I? Everything about you pleases me. It can never be
    otherwise.</p>
<h6 class="HENRIETTE.">HENRIETTE.</h6> 
<p class="speech">How interesting! That's the very reason I rejected your
    proposal. I sha'n't marry until I am certain that I shall not be
    continually pestered with compliments and flattery and submission. The
    man who marries me shall make it his business to remind me of my
    shortcomings, to correct all my mistakes. He must give me the assurance
    that I am continually bettering myself.</p>
<h6 class="JACQUES.">JACQUES.</h6>
<p class="speech">And this--husband--have you found him already?</p> 
<h6 class="HENRIETTE.">HENRIETTE.</h6>
<p class=""speech">What--? Oh, who knows?</p> 
<h6 class="JACQUES.">JACQUES.</h6>
<p class="speech">Perhaps it's--Albert?</p>
<h6 class="HENRIETTE.">HENRIETTE. </h6>
<p class=""speech">Perhaps it is--what of it?</p> 
<h6 class="JACQUES.">JACQUES</h6>
<p class="speech">Really!</p>
<h6 class="HENRIETTE.">HENRIETTE.</h6>
<p class="speech">You want me to speak frankly?</p>
<h6 class="JACQUES.">JACQUES.</h6>
<p class="speech">Of course.</p>
<h6 class="HENRIETTE.">HENRIETTE.</h6>
<p class="speech">Then--you wouldn't be annoyed if I said something nice about
    Albert?</p> 
<p class="direction">[JACQUES _brings down_ C. _chair which is by desk, facing_
